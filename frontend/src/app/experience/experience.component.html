    <p class="position">Software Engineer</p>
    <p class="desc">I am currently working in both production support and development on a rotational basis in Visa. In my production role, I respond to production incidents and help maintain a 99.99% availability and 100% patching compliance for vulnerabilities. I also handle production installs. Greatly inspired by SRE concepts, I aim to automate what I can in my role, reducing the time taken to carry out several tedious processes from several hours to minutes or even seconds. Typically, I do so using Python and shell scripts.

    In my development role, I work on feature improvements and bug fixes for Java applications.

    <p class="position">Quality Assurance Intern</p>
    <p class="desc">In 2018, I decided to experience the start-up culture overseas in Vietnam. I worked as a QA performing black-box UI and functional testing on web and mobile applications. During my time there, I explored using Selenium, Appium and Applitools Eyes to help with my tasks. Apart from acting as a QA, I also supported the project manager by helping to delegate tasks and interact with clients where needed. The team worked in a Kanban way using Trello.
