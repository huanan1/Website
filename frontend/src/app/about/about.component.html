    <p>Hi! I’m Huan An.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’m a software engineer with experience working in different roles, including development, QA and production, using a range of technologies and frameworks. I’m often described as a responsible and reliable individual who is a good team-player as well as an independent worker.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My go-to programming language is Python, partly because I mainly deal with automation and backend development. However, I have also used Java, Golang, Typescript, Javascript and C# in projects that call for them. I also have experience with various different libraries, software and tools depending on the project requirements. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I graduated with a Bachelors in Engineering (Honours with Distinction), Information Systems Technology and Design degree from Singapore University of Technology and Design in 2020.</p>
